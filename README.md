# Project to help my friend analyze his business and make data driven decisions to maximize Revenue, Customer Satisfaction, and Inventory management


This project uses various data sources with anonymized data for PPI(Currently In Progress) that track orders, CRM, Inventory, and HR costs.

Output of this project is a dashboard hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that my friend can access anytime to get insights about trends, expected sales and recommendations based on models. This will be updated periodically and hosted IP might change because the Server will be turned off and on as needed.
